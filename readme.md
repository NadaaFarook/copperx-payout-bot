- **Wallets**: Fetching balances, setting default wallet
- **Transfers**: Sending money, bank withdrawals
- **Notifications**: Real-time deposit alerts via Pusher

## Troubleshooting

**Bot not responding?**

- Check if your bot token is correct
- Make sure Redis is running: `redis-cli ping`

**Login problems?**

- Verify your email is registered with Copperx
- Check if the API is accessible

**Transfer issues?**

- Confirm you have enough balance
- Make sure your KYC is approved
- Double-check recipient details

## Under the hood

Built with NestJS and Telegraf, the bot uses a modular architecture:

- Redis for secure session storage
- Middleware for auth protection
- Pusher for real-time notifications
- Strong typing throughout

Security features include token encryption, session timeouts, and transaction confirmations.
